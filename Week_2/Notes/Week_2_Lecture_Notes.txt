Good practice to keep comments at the TOP of a code block.

Don't comment after each line in the code block.  Summarize what you're doing at the top of the code block. 

Can use the double quotes to do a comment block

Naming convention is snake_case (all lowercase)
	use the object type as a suffix.

	"cars_df" would be a car data frame

	Don't put spaces in file names! things will break!

The .Rmd file has a play button for each segment to test output

R is a 1-based indexing language, not 0

=========================
Vector is an array of like-type variables

Can create a vector specifying certain elements by doing c(1,5,10) and that returns the 3 chosen elements.  This is good for SLICING an existing vector

To remove an element from a vector, call the index with a negative sign like fib_vec[-1]

convert date using as.Date

print the structure first to see how the date structure is.  

format=%m%d%Y

mm/dd/yyyy


Question 7 may need aggregate function?


t <- table(factor(sales$table))
